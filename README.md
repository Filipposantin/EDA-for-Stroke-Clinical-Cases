# EDA-for-Stroke-Clinical-Cases
Statistical learning
The main goal of the project is a study on stroke disease in which we try to explain from statistical analysis some correlation factors and statistics of the given features, by designing models to predict the presence of stroke disease. In addition, we highlight possible linear and non-linear relationships among the given features and the stroke disease variable.
